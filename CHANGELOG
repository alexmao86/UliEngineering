## 0.3
Somewhat breaking changes to EngineerIO internal APIs:
normalize_numeric() works as before, but other (lower-level) functions returned namedtuples
instead of tuples, and additionally parse separate prefix and unit prefix values.
This allows for fine-grained control and validation of values like "Â±5%"
